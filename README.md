**Blue Glass** is an open-source framework for interpretability and analysis of vision-language and vision-only models. It empowers researchers and practitioners to understand what deep models *see* and *focus on* by offering tools to extract, probe, and build ad hoc XAI models for internal representations.


**Blue Glass** is an open-source framework for interpretability and analysis of vision-language and vision-only models. It empowers researchers and practitioners to understand what deep models see and attend to by providing tools to extract, probe, and build ad-hoc XAI models on internal representations.

The framework includes a custom infrastructure and lightweight modifications to third-party model libraries, enabling seamless feature extraction from the models. These extracted features are compiled into structured datasets called **Blue Glass-Lens**, laying the foundation for advanced Explainable AI research and experimentation.

## ✨ Key Features

- 📊 **Benchmarking & Probing**  
  Seamless support for benchmarking and probing internal representations at different model layers.
  
- 🧠 **Blue Glass-Lens Dataset**  
  A feature dataset generated by intercepting model activations via a custom interceptor called the **Feature Recorder**.

- 🧪 **Ad-hoc Interpretability Models**  
  Leverage the Blue Glass-Lens dataset to train models like:
  - Linear Probes  
  - Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs)  
  - Other direct interpretability techniques  
  All optimized for **large batch sizes** and efficient performance.

- 🧰 **Generate Custom Blue Glass-Lens Dataset**  
  Use the built-in tools to generate your own **Blue Glass-Lens** dataset from any model.
 
- 🔁 **Feature Patching & Re-Integration**  
  Ad-hoc models can be patched back into the base model using the **Feature Patcher**, enabling:  
  - Validation of interpretability methods  
  - Performance benchmarking of modified models

- 🚀 **Streamlined Runner**  
  A simplified, plug-and-play design built around modular runners and interfaces for training, validating, and evaluating ad-hoc models.

- ⚙️ **Scalable Training**  
  - Native support for **distributed training**  
  - Central control over **precision** (e.g., FP16, BF16)

- 🔍 **Interpretability & Analysis**  
  Built for both **vision-language** and **vision-only** models with a focus on **clarity**, **transparency**, and **scalability**.
